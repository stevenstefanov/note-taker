# note-taker

## What is the project?

This project is a note taking app which lets a user create notes, store them, retrieve them at a later time, and delete them.

## What were the challenges?

It was challenging to assign each note a unique id so that individual notes could be deleted at a later time.

## What was updated?

This project had some starter code such as the html and css files. The server.js file was created from scratch.

## Why did I decide to do this project?

I live by my notes. I write just about everything down in my work and personal life. I love just being able ot pull up my phone and have all my reminders and notes saved in there.

## What I learned in the process?

Throughout this project I became more comfortable with deploying to Heroku, creating server requests and working with middleware.

## What makes this project stand out?

This is a good project that exemplifies the use of express and server database manipulation.
