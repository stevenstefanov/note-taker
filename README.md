## Background

I live by my notes. I write just about everything down in my work and personal life. I love just being able ot pull up my phone and have all my reminders and notes saved in there.

## Challenges

It was challenging to figure out how to assign each note a unique id so that individual notes could be deleted at a later time.

## Learnings

Throughout this project I became more comfortable with deploying to Heroku, creating server requests and working with middleware.

## Usage

When the app loads, the user is prompted to create a new note. When they type in a note and save it, it will get stored with any other entered notes on the left side of the page. If the user had previously entered notes, they would also appear on the left side.

## Credits

Thank you to Columbia's Full-Stack Web Developer bootcamp for all the assistance and for teaching me all that I have learned.
